Hi everyone,

This is just a collection of small tasks I have been assigned to
over a collection of my courses, that I deemed interesting enough to put up here.
Ultimately, they are not all that impressive, but are more or less
a portfolio of sorts so that I can review my growth and review my old work
to see how I might be able to improve upon my own understanding and see how far I
have come.

Thanks!
Jack
